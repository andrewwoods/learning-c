The chapter begins where every programming language tutorial begins -
hello world. Their example of compiling hello world uses the GCC
compiler. They advise the reader to check with an expert on how to
compile on your system. I'm on a Mac, and had previously run a xcode
related command that installed the CLang compiler. So I run this to
compile my code

```
$ clang hello.c
```

This gives me the following output.

```
hello-world.c:3:1: warning: type specifier missing, defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
```

The compiler wants me to add `int` as the return type.

My modern C compiler gives me this warning, because by default it uses
the "ISO  C  2011 with GNU extensions", and the 2nd edition of the book
was written in 1988. So I'm setting an option to use the C89 standard
for compilation. This removes the warning.

```
$ clang -std=c89 hello-world.c
```

Just like their example, the clang compiler supports `-o` option to
change the name of the output file.

```
$ clang -std=c89 -o hello-world hello-world.c
```

## Temperature Conversion

The authors introduce the variables, symbolic constants, and the while loop. The
first code example of temperature conversion from fahrenheit to celsius uses
integer math. The authors use it to demonstrate that data can get lost by using
the wrong types of data. In their subsequent code, they change the farenheit and
celsius values to floats.
