# Learning C

__Learning the fundamentals of the C programming language__

I thought it'd be interesting to finally learn C programming. There's a
lot to learn, before I'll be able to write an application of
significance. Ultimately, the goal is to be good enough to be able to
make contributions to PHP core. As a long time user of the PHP language,
writing web applications, it'd be amazing to be able to point to a
feature in the language and say "I did that". Will I ever get there?
Will life have other plans? Who knows. But it will only be possible, if
I'm able to develop code in C. I gotta start somewhere. This interest in
C was ignited by an article called "Avoiding Busses" by Joe Watkins. I
wrote a response with my thoughts on [How to Attract Developers to PHP
Core](https://andrewwoods.net/blog/2021/attracting-developers-php-core/),
so this this repo is the first of many baby steps, to be able to meet
the need.   


My plan for this repo is to write posts for this journey, along side the
code. So if you keep coming back to this repo, you'll see some new
posts. I'm not going to clutter my blog with these language learning
posts. If you're reading this on GitHub, you're exactly the type of
person that might find this interesting.

## Posts

It's tempting to jump straight into watching tutorials on YouTube.
Instead, I'm using a more structured approach. To get started, I'm
reading the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and
Dennis M. Ritchie - which is one of the definitive books on software
development, especially for C developers. So I'm gonna do the exercises
in each chapter. The posts I write will be a reflection on the content,
and my experience writing solutions for the exercises.
